When you call app.get('/', handler):

Express stores the route and handler in an internal routing table, something like:

javascript
Copy code
[
  { method: 'GET', path: '/', handler: (req, res, next) => { /* handler code */ } }
];
When a client makes a request, Express:

Uses the http module to receive the request.
Loops through its routing table to find a matching route.
If a match is found, it calls the handler with (req, res, next).
When you call res.send():

Internally, Express uses http.ServerResponse.write() and http.ServerResponse.end() to send the response.


//it is good to know concept
Here's a conceptual representation of what Express might be doing behind the scenes:

Registering Routes (app.get)
javascript
Copy code
const routes = []; // Internal routing table

function registerRoute(method, path, handler) {
  routes.push({ method, path, handler });
}

function app(req, res) {
  const { method, url } = req;

  // Find the matching route
  const route = routes.find(r => r.method === method && r.path === url);
  if (route) {
    route.handler(req, res); // Call the handler
  } else {
    res.statusCode = 404;
    res.end('Not Found');
  }
}

app.get = (path, handler) => registerRoute('GET', path, handler);
Handling Requests
When a client sends a GET request:

Node.js's http module receives the request.
Express parses the request and calls the matching handler:
javascript
Copy code
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  app(req, res); // Pass control to Express (or your app function)
});

server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));


express is a factory function with its properties bodyParse, static,jsonetc and when we call that function it will return the app instance which is again a factory function with it's own properties like use,send, post ,delete , patch , get , put etc
