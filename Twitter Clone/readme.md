When you call app.get('/', handler):

Express stores the route and handler in an internal routing table, something like:

javascript
Copy code
[
  { method: 'GET', path: '/', handler: (req, res, next) => { /* handler code */ } }
];
When a client makes a request, Express:

Uses the http module to receive the request.
Loops through its routing table to find a matching route.
If a match is found, it calls the handler with (req, res, next).
When you call res.send():

Internally, Express uses http.ServerResponse.write() and http.ServerResponse.end() to send the response.


//it is good to know concept
Here's a conceptual representation of what Express might be doing behind the scenes:

Registering Routes (app.get)
javascript
Copy code
const routes = []; // Internal routing table

function registerRoute(method, path, handler) {
  routes.push({ method, path, handler });
}

function app(req, res) {
  const { method, url } = req;

  // Find the matching route
  const route = routes.find(r => r.method === method && r.path === url);
  if (route) {
    route.handler(req, res); // Call the handler
  } else {
    res.statusCode = 404;
    res.end('Not Found');
  }
}

app.get = (path, handler) => registerRoute('GET', path, handler);
Handling Requests
When a client sends a GET request:

Node.js's http module receives the request.
Express parses the request and calls the matching handler:
javascript
Copy code
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  app(req, res); // Pass control to Express (or your app function)
});

server.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));


express is a factory function with its properties bodyParse, static,jsonetc and when we call that function it will return the app instance which is again a factory function with it's own properties like use,send, post ,delete , patch , get , put etc




//another query
 mean when i send email only ...and now i am destructuring if will create the local scope and create another object and assign value to if and if value is on the req.body it assigns it otherwise if we set the key as undefined


Exactly, youâ€™ve got it! ðŸŽ‰

When you send only the email in your request, and you destructure req.body like this:

javascript
Copy code
const { fullname, email, username, bio } = req.body;
Hereâ€™s what happens step by step:

Destructuring Creates Local Variables:

It creates new variables (fullname, email, username, and bio) in the current function's scope.
Assign Values from req.body:

If a key exists in req.body, its value is assigned to the corresponding variable.
If a key is missing (e.g., username or bio), the variable is set to undefined.
